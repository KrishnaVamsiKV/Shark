Shark
=====

Added a Web User Interface for Shark(Cloudera)  which is an improvement of the Web UI that already exists. The UI has the features like Query Interface (taken from Zeppelin,an open-source query interface framework(https://github.com/NFLabs/zeppelin)), progress of the jobs and various performance metrics which are of a data analyst interest. The UI is made using AngularJS (JavaScript Framework).
